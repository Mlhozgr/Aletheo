  <div style="text-align: center;font-size: 50px;">RAID</div>
  <p style="font-size: 20px;">tldr: a farm protocol that shills itself for around a millennium(1000 years) ahead, any possibility of a rug is restricted by the code, I do not own non-upgareable base contracts</p>
  <p>RAID is hiring community managers and <span style="font-style: italic;">paid</span> mods for different language telegram chats and twitter management, ask in tg. Also translating the website and the paper to your language will be rewarded. And for hackers: bug bounty will hopefully be generous or at least on par with the standards.</p>

  <div><p style="text-align: center;font-size: 25px;">Decentralized word-of-mouth marketing service*</p>

<p>As of today internet personality bubble reaches absurd levels, a mere mention of a brand by an internet celebrity could cost thousands of dollars and much more in the future. It is generally believed that buying internet personalities' time or creating an ad-trailer should be expensive and it’s worth it, however it appears than a new more effective alternative to this already exists and actively being used.</p>
<p>What ad trailers and internet personalities attempt to do is not only to sell but also to start a <span style="font-style: italic;">discussion</span>. Word-of-mouth marketing, proof-of-discussion, whether it's praising or sick burning, FUD or optimistic insights, blind cult following or elaborate arguments, - the discussion behind the product is what really promotes the product. Celebrities and ads are just a third-party and it is certainly possible to eliminate this third-party and pay directly for discussion and mentions instead. A mass discussion by nobodies for nobodies.</p>
<p>And it appears that it is certainly possible to achieve this in a decentralized manner when the employer and the worker don't need to know anything about each other except the stake, eliminating the need of assembling a marketing team or trying to apply to real-life jobs.</p>
<p>RAID Token speculative value is fundamentally required as an auto-moderation measure. Market peak buyers are more likely to have less stake and less reputation, maintaining the quality of the service, decreasing (or even eliminating, depending on chosen route) any need to moderate the campaign by an employer.</p>
<p>RAID solves blockchain wealth distribution problem by implementing old like the world CeFi feature - active income(salaries). With it, RAID can expect Gini coefficient closer to real world CeFi levels than any other blockchain project. This pushes decentralization security standards on another level. This is the token which will provide income to socially inept, traumatized, schizophrenic, mentally challenged and physically disabled people and hopefully, so that they will never be kicked out of their homes for being unable to adapt to life. Hopefully, someday in the future shitposting job in RAID will reach close to minimum wage levels of salary.</p>
<p>Employers setup and fund campaigns in Raid Market contract with certain keywords or topics on chosen websites, workers commit to these campaigns by discussing certain posts or anything eligible(matching keyword) for paid discussion. By default, workers are allowed to express genuine opinion on every topic, it can be positive or negative, sincere or a blatant lie, and, depending on the resource, workers by default have the right to completely derail the discussion, talk about weather, discuss investments, etc. Workers will still get paid for unrelated discussion as long as it for example bumps the thread, or adds another comment to discussion making it look more heated and popular. Again, it mostly depends on the resource and a forum could simply ban/remove unrelated posts. Posts have to be witnessed by oracles, so a worker has to ensure that his posts won’t be removed.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">*Taken out of the whitepaper I found on torrents. Here it is. To be clear I am a different Sam Porter. As he claims, English is not that man' first language. I will eventually remove most of what's written there, because it makes no sense. You have to be either mentally challenged or a schizo, or an autist to read this 40 pages long word salad: </p><span><a href="/RAID whitepaper.pdf" download>RAID whitepaper</a></span>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;">Founding Event</p>
<p>Basically like proposed by CORE team Liquidity Generation Event, but liquidity is not locked and it lasts for around 2 months, and it's trustl minimized: non-upgradeable and I can't stop it, liquidity will be created automatically. Founders are supposed to protect the integrity of governance, so <span style="font-style: italic;">collectively</span> will have great voting power. The Event starts <span style="font-weight: bold;">soon</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 25px;">Betatest</p>
<p>Betatest will go live soon. During first stage of betatest, workers will receive 1 RAID mainnet token per unique post. After the Founding Event is over, workers will be able to claim their rewards which will be gradually released overtime. Moderation will mainly focus on blatant spam botting, like posting a random hash to make post unique, and on whatever is considered illegal. The rules of what is considered spam or illegal which is not eligible for a reward will be defined as clear as possible.</p>
